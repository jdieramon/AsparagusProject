Here, we performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to understand the genetic control of quantitative agronomic traits in garden asparagus. Take-away message:  
1. Two major QTLs for number of stalk and earliness were mapped in a genomic region that spans 3.25 Mb and includes the sex-determination locus on chromosome 1. 
2. Some QTLs for branching height and earliness were detected in a bin that spans 4.96 Mb on chromosome 5.   
3. Functional annotation of genes within the two genomic regions revealed candidate genes with potential roles in SA and light signaling and photomorphogenesis pathways that may be involved in branching and/or tillering.
